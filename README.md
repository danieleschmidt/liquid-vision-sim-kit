# liquid-vision-sim-kit
The liquid-vision-sim-kit provides a comprehensive framework for generating neuromorphic datasets and training Liquid Neural Networks (LNNs) specifically designed for event-based cameras on resource-constrained edge devices (Cortex-M, ESP32). This project addresses the critical gap in open-source simulators for Liquid AI models
